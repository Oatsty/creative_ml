    "## Deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is currently the most successful subfield of machine learning that deals with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain through artificial neural networks. It enables computers to learn from vast amounts of data and has revolutionized various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why deep architectures?\n",
    "Deep architectures are essential because they allow models to learn hierarchical representations from raw input data. These hierarchical representations can capture increasingly complex and abstract features as the network depth increases. This capability enables deep learning models to achieve state-of-the-art results in many tasks, as they can automatically learn to extract relevant features from the input data without relying on hand-engineered features.\n",

    "## Challenges in deep architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in the course, there are several impediments in learning deep architectures, namely\n",
    "1. Vanishing gradient\n",
    "2. Overfitting issues\n",
    "3. Multiple local minima\n",
    "4. Instability in the training\n",
    "Here, we briefly discuss the two major problems, namely _vanishing gradient_ and _overfitting_.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vanishing gradient\n",
    "One of the main challenges in training deep architectures is the vanishing gradient problem. It occurs when gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters become too small as they backpropagate through the layers. This issue leads to slow convergence and poor performance, as the weights in the earlier layers do not get updated significantly during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overfitting\n",
    "Another challenge in deep learning is overfitting, where the model learns to perform well on the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data. Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and weight decay, are used to prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model or by making the training process more robust.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Layer-wise Pretraining\n",
    "To address the vanishing gradient problem and improve the training of deep architectures, layer-wise pretraining was proposed. In this approach, each layer of the deep architecture is pretrained independently, usually with unsupervised learning methods like autoencoders, before fine-tuning the entire network using supervised learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autoencoders\n",
    "_Autoencoders_ are unsupervised learning models that learn to reconstruct their input data. They consist of an encoder that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation and a decoder that reconstructs the input data from the lower-dimensional representation. Autoencoders can be used to learn useful features from the data and initialize the weights of a deep architecture during layer-wise pretraining. As we have seen, an interesting variant of autoencoders are _denoising autoencoders_ that learn to reconstruct the input data from a corrupted version of it. By learning to recover the original data from the corrupted version, denoising autoencoders can capture more robust and meaningful features. They can be used in layer-wise pretraining to improve the training of deep architectures further."

Autoencoders are unsupervised learning models that can learn useful features from the input data. They consist of an encoder, which maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation, and a decoder, which reconstructs the input data from the lower-dimensional representation. _Deep autoencoders_ are multi-layer autoencoders that can learn more abstract and complex features from the input data. To learn such models, _layer-wise training_ was historically used as a technique to help overcome the vanishing gradient problem and initializes the network with better weights, leading to improved performance. Hence, we aim to _pretrain each layer individually_ in an **unsupervised** manner, followed by fine-tuning the entire network with _supervised learning."

    "\n",
    "The following question is entirely open, without any specific code guideline to follow. This is aimed at exercising your own problem-solving skills in order to define the code architecture by yourself. Now that we have a finetuned auto-encoder, we would like to use the _encoding_ part for _supervised classification_. As seen in class, this amounts to a form of _transfer learning_. Hence, we need to retrieve the encoder and add extra layers that we will train in a supervised manner (in order to recognize the class of different fashion items).\n",

These advances are _batch normalization_, _ReLU_ activations and _Dropout_. Furthermore, by definition, the AE can already be seen as a form of _generative model_ (although it lacks a probabilistic definition). \n",

Hence, we will need an `encoder`, which compresses the images into a small latent vector, and a `decoder`, that reconstructs the original image from this code. Here, we will start very basic and define the encoder and decoder as simple `Linear` layers. Note that we also use `BatchNorm`, `ReLU` and `Dropout` to regularize our training."

    "Imagine (for the sake of argument), that we choose an encoding dimension which is of same dimensionality as the input one. Then, one huge problem is that nothing prevents the AE from simply learning the _identity_ function (try to imagine why). An autoencoder can also be trained to remove noise from images. This type of _regularization_ prevents the model from learning this degenerate situation.\n",

    "Attention mechanisms enable models to focus on specific parts of the input sequence while processing it. They have been proven to be highly effective in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and sentiment analysis. Transformers are a type of deep learning model that incorporates self-attention mechanisms. They consist of an encoder and a decoder, and utilize multi-head attention layers, positional encoding, and layer normalization."
